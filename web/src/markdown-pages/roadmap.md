## Need more info

-   Connect Page: I have a couple thoughts here:

    -   I like the idea of this page, but it feels similar to the "I'm New" page. Do you want to re-work the "I'm New" page to account for some of this stuff?
    -   It seems like the page could be trying to do too much. Sign up for discover, go join a group, sign-up for coffee with a pastor, sign-up to serve. That's a lot of requests we're making of the user.

    -   I would treat this like a virtual "Guest Stop" just for 2nd-time guests.

    ```
    "Welcome back and thank you for joining us at Venture Church. We have lots of ways to learn more about the church and get connect."
    ```

    Then give a form: Get there Name, Email, Phone, and allow them to check up to 3 boxes: Discover 101 (Dinner with our Lead Pastors), Coffee with a staff member, information to start serving (We may even omit this. Don't we get this info when we meet with them in-person? Does Discover 101 talk about the importance of serving at the church?)

    For groups, I would do a big thing below the form that "Check out our Growth Groups". But I would only have that when we want them signing up. Now would not be a great time nor would the month of December. When it's not a good time, I'd say something like "Growth Groups will be relaunching [Soon/On Date/next month], keep an eye out for more updates at our Sunday service" -- or something like that.

-   Groups Page Dream/wish list
-   Prayer page -- We can do whatever you want. Does Gabe have a vision for this? We can add a photo to each station. We can add a photo to the landing page, I would just need some direction.

## Jim's List

-   Add "Announcement" (or "news") schema and pages (similar to events, but not tied to a specific date).
-   Support embedded images and youtube videos
-   Design tweaks
    -   Decrease the header height on mobile devices
    -   Fix exit animation of the navigation
-   Photo gallery experience (for things like Easter and Trunk or Treat)
-   Work with Boone and Gabe for old messages and podcast links
-   Allow the text on the contact page to be modified in the CMS.
